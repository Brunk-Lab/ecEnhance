    "# ecDNA Detection Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains an automated pipeline for detecting and quantifying extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) images. The pipeline processes paired RGB FISH images and DAPI grayscale images to identify and classify ecDNA and chromosome-associated objects. It aims to improve upon manual counting and existing tools like MIA by offering a scalable, accurate, and automated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Preprocessing**: Masks the RGB FISH image using the DAPI grayscale image to isolate nuclear regions, converting the result to grayscale for further processing.  \n",
    "2. **Image Enhancement**: Applies a sequence of techniques to enhance ecDNA visibility:  \n",
    "   - Top-Hat Filtering: Highlights small bright spots (ecDNA).  \n",
    "   - Sharpening: Enhances object edges.  \n",
    "   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization): Improves contrast.  \n",
    "   - Sigmoid Transformation: Boosts ecDNA signal clarity.  \n",
    "3. **Object Detection**: Identifies potential ecDNA and chromosome objects through:  \n",
    "   - Thresholding: Creates a binary image.  \n",
    "   - Morphological Cleaning: Removes noise and refines objects.  \n",
    "   - Connected Components Analysis: Labels objects with bounding boxes.  \n",
    "   - Object Merging: Combines nearby objects.  \n",
    "4. **Object Classification**: Classifies detected objects as 'ecDNA' or 'chromosomes' based on HSV color properties.  \n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses Bayesian Optimization to tune parameters, minimizing error (e.g., MdAPE).  \n",
    "6. **Validation and Comparison**: Compares pipeline results to manual ground truth and MIA predictions using statistical metrics and visualizations.  \n",
    "7. **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple images in parallel, generating structured outputs like CSV and JSON files.\n",
